% peaks = OSET_MaxSearch(x,f,flag),
% R-peak detector based on max search
%
% inputs:
% x_ini: vector of input data
% ff: approximate ECG beat-rate in Hertz, normalized by the sampling frequency
% flag: search for positive (flag=1) or negative (flag=0) peaks. By default
% the maximum absolute value of the signal, determines the peak sign.
%
% output:
% peaks: vector of R-peak impulse train
%
% Notes:
% - The R-peaks are found from a peak search in windows of length N; where 
% N corresponds to the R-peak period calculated from the given f. R-peaks 
% with periods smaller than N/2 or greater than N are not detected.
% - The signal baseline wander is recommended to be removed before the
% R-peak detection
